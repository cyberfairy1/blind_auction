Auction Bidding Program
This Python program simulates a simple auction where multiple users can place bids. The program identifies the highest bidder once all bids are submitted.

Features

Cross-Platform Screen Clearing: Clears the console screen after each bid to provide a cleaner user interface.
Highest Bidder Identification: Automatically identifies and displays the highest bidder when the auction ends.

How to Use
Run the program in a Python environment.
Enter your name when prompted.
Enter your bid amount in whole dollars.
The program will ask if there are more bidders:
Type yes to continue with another bidder.
Type no to finish the auction.
Once all bids are in, the program announces the highest bidder.

Example
Enter your name: Alice
Enter your bid: $150
Are there more bidders? Type 'yes' or 'no': yes

Enter your name: Bob
Enter your bid: $200
Are there more bidders? Type 'yes' or 'no': no

The top bidder is Bob with a bid of $200
